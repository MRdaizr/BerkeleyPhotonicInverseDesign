REQUIREMENTS
MATLAB 2012b
Lumerical FDTD Solutions Version 8
Optional: pbs_server to manage a cluster job queue

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
1. Copy all Photonic Inverse Design files to a Windows/Linux machine
2. Edit runOpt_params.m
   lumerical = /path/to/lumerical/fdtd-solutions;
          On Linux, this may look like 
          lumerical = '/data/lumerical/fdtd/bin/CAD';
          On Windows, this may look like
          (single and double quotes needed because of spaces in the file
          path)
          lumerical = '"C:\Program Files\Lumerical\FDTD\bin\fdtd-solutions.exe"';
   queueName = 'local' or a pbs_server queue;
          To run Lumerical simulations on the local machine:
          queueName = 'local';
          To run Lumerical simulations as a job in a pbs_server queue:
          (edit runParallelLum.m to customize the job submission process)
          queueName = 'queueName';
3. Open MATLAB. Navigate to /path/to/PhotonicInverseDesign/. 'runOpt' begins an optimization.
